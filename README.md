# Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict the presence of diabetes based on patient data.

## Files
- `diabetes_ml.ipynb`: Main notebook with model training and evaluation
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset used
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`: Extra data for training/testing
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb`: (Optional) Titanic ML exercise

## Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Output: Classification report with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the requirements
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
